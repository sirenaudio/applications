# Siren Audio Generative & Feedback applications for Mac & Windows

Dear Internet Traveller,

Many moons ago I made a couple of audio software applications that I distributed commercially.

I used a third party copy protection system that did things like ask users for a new password when they plugged a new monitor in.

We all make mistakes.

Anyway, the software is here, free for you to use and redistribute, though thou shalt not make any cash selling it.

It may or may not work, and is provided as is. Apologies to those who have continued to use the apps and couldn't because of authorisation issues.

There are no plans for any future work on the applications.

Cheers,

Mike (Siren Audio creator)
